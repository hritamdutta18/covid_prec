# CoviPrec

It is a small website enlisting COVID-19 precautions, few of the top COVID-19 articles & a form for filling up the contact details.

## Components for Front-End

1)  HTML, to build the webpage.
2)  CSS, a user stylesheet along with the Bootstrap Framework.
3)  JavaScript, to handle few events.

## Components for Back-End

There is no back-end support as of now. I might add it later.
